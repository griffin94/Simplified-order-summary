# INVO Academy

This project was made to level up front-end skills with hands-on INVO Academy.

## Scripts

If you run your this project for the first time, you need to install npm dependencies by typing

`npm install` (this is for the one-time installation only)

In order to run your project in a development mode type

`npm run dev`

then open your browser and go to the url showed in the terminal. That's it, if you make any changes in the code, browser will synchronize automatically.

To build and deploy the application to gh-pages at the same time, type:

`npm run deploy`

Just to build an app, type:

`npm run build`

This commend will create a dist folder. This is the folder containing your whole application and that's the only folder that you need to deploy to the server in order to make your app publically available.
